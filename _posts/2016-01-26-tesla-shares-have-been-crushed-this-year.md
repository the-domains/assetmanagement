description: "Tesla shares are getting clobbered: they're down almost 20% this year after dropping another 3% Tuesday to $191. That's a far cry from their 2014 peak of nearly $300. The latest dip is being chalked up to a research note from JP Morgan's Ryan Brinkman, in which his team reduced its expectations for Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings."
